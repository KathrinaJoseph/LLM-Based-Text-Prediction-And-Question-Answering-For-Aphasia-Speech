Aphasia Speech Assistant using RoBERTa
This project builds a language model-based system to assist patients with Aphasia — a language disorder that affects speech production and comprehension. The system performs text prediction and question answering on fragmented or disfluent speech using RoBERTa-based models, helping reconstruct meaningful communication.

🚀 Features
✅ Speech-to-Text Transcription using AssemblyAI

✅ Masked Word Prediction using RoBERTa (Masked Language Model)

✅ Question Answering using fine-tuned RoBERTa QA model

✅ Handles disfluencies and speech gaps often seen in aphasia patients

✅ Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, F1 Score, BLEU Score

💡 Motivation
Aphasia patients often struggle with missing words, fragmented speech, or incomplete sentences. Traditional speech analysis tools are not designed for such irregular input. This project leverages modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to:

Reconstruct missing words

Understand patient intent

Answer questions from partial speech

Assist therapy and communication

🔧 Technologies Used
RoBERTa-base (Masked Language Model)

RoBERTa-base-SQuAD2 (Question Answering Model)

Hugging Face Transformers

PyTorch

AssemblyAI (Speech-to-Text API)

Python 3.8+

📊 Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Purpose
Accuracy	Correct full predictions
Precision	Reliability of correct predictions
F1 Score	Balance between precision and recall
BLEU Score	Similarity between predicted and reference text

🗂 Dataset
Custom dataset generated from speech samples with disfluency masking and QA pairs extracted.

The project can easily adapt to real-world speech datasets (e.g. AphasiaBank).

🔨 Installation
⿡ Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aphasia-speech-assistant.git
cd aphasia-speech-assistant
⿢ Install required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch transformers assemblyai datasets
⿣ Set up AssemblyAI API key in your code:

python
Copy
Edit
aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
🧪 Running the Project
Upload speech files (.wav) to transcribe and process.

The system automatically:

Transcribes speech

Extracts patient utterances

Masks disfluencies

Predicts missing words

Answers questions from the transcript

Sample commands and code provided in:
📂 main.py
📂 text_prediction.py
📂 question_answering.py

📈 Results
The system achieves good performance in reconstructing sentences from aphasia speech and accurately answering simple context-based questions. Evaluation is done using both strict (accuracy) and flexible (BLEU score) metrics.
